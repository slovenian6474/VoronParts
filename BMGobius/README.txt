This is a modification to MZBot's Mobius Extruder to use dual drive Bondtech drivegears.
https://github.com/mzbotreprap/VORON/tree/master/STLs/VORON2/VORON%20Mobius

You will need to substitue the 45mm long 5mm diameter shaft for a 60mm long shaft

The rest of the hardware is the same with the obvious replacement of the MK8 and bearing with Bondtech drivegears.
